Task 2: 
    Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
    Create these empty files:
        c/c_is_fun.c
        js/main.js
        js/index.js
    Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
    Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
    Add all these new files to git
    Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server

Task 3: For this project, create a branch update_script and in this branch:

    Create an empty file named bash/98
    Update bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School"
    Update bash/school by replacing echo "School" with echo "The school is open!"
    Add and commit these changes (message: “My personal work”)
    Push this new branch Tips

Perfect! You did an amazing update in your project and it’s isolated correctly from the main branch.

Ho wait, your manager needs a quick fix in your project and it needs to be deployed now:

    Change branch to main
    Update the file bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School is so cool!"
    Delete the directory js
    Commit your changes (message: “Hot fix”) and push to the origin

Task 4: Edit the README file on the github site.
After you have done that, in your terminal:

    Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your README.md file will be updated)
    Create a new file up_to_date at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used
    Add up_to_date to git, commit (message: “How to be up to date in git”), and push to the origin


Task 5: merge the branch update_script to main: “Cool, all my changes will be now part of the main branch, ready to be deployed!”
resolve conflicts by using the version of the branch update_script, and push the result to the origin.

Task 6: Create a .gitignore file and define a rule to never push ~ files (generated by Emacs).
